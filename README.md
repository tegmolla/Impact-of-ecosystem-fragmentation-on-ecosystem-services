# Impact-of-ecosystem-fragmentation-on-ecosystem-services
The provision of the four ES varies significantly across different ecosystem types and is shaped by distinct ecosystem processes inherent to each service type. This variation highlights the unique roles that specific ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands, play in supporting and regulating ES flow. Additionally, the four ES are influenced differently by fragmentation indices, such as area, perimeter-area ratio, and proximity, which capture different aspects of landscape structure and spatial configuration. 
For example, while the area might directly determine the capacity of an ecosystem to support biodiversity or biomass production, the perimeter-area ratio often relates to edge effects that influence ecological interactions. Proximity, as a fragmentation index, further emphasises the spatial arrangement of patches relative to one another, which is particularly relevant for services that depend on connectivity or spillover effects, such as pollination. Importantly, the calculation of proximity and other fragmentation indices is tailored to reflect specific buffer distances for each ES, ensuring that each serviceâ€™s unique spatial scale and flow dynamics are appropriately captured and modeled. This nuanced approach allows for a more precise understanding of how fragmentation impacts the spatial provision of multiple ES over time.
